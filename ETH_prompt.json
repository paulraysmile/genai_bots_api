      "Safety: Keep your cat indoors to protect them from potential dangers such as traffic predators and diseases. If you allow outdoor access ensure they have proper identification such as a collar with ID tags or a microchip.",
      "Affection and Attention: Spend quality time with your cat every day. Cats enjoy social interaction and affection from their owners. Respect their boundaries and allow them to initiate contact.",
      "Environment: Create a safe and comfortable environment for your cat. Provide cozy resting spots hiding places and vertical space for climbing and exploring.",
      "Behavioral Training: Use positive reinforcement techniques to train your cat and discourage undesirable behaviors. Reward good behavior with treats or praise and avoid punishment.",

      "Here:",
      "Location: Azaleas prefer partial shade ideally receiving morning sun and afternoon shade. They also prefer well-drained soil that is rich in organic matter.",
      "Watering: Keep the soil consistently moist but not waterlogged. Water deeply when you water and avoid letting the soil dry out completely.",
      "Mulching: Apply a layer of mulch around the base of the plant to help retain moisture in the soil and suppress weeds. This also helps to moderate soil temperature.",
      "Fertilizing: Azaleas benefit from a balanced fertilizer formulated for acid-loving plants. Apply fertilizer in the spring after the blooming period has finished.",
      "Pruning: Prune azaleas after they finish blooming to maintain their shape and encourage new growth. Remove dead or diseased branches and thin out crowded areas to improve air circulation.",
      "Protection from Frost: In colder climates protect azaleas from frost damage by covering them with a breathable fabric or bringing container-grown plants indoors during cold snaps.",
      "Pest and Disease Control: Keep an eye out for common pests like lace bugs spider mites and aphids. Treat infestations promptly with insecticidal soap or horticultural oil. Also watch for signs of diseases such as powdery mildew or leaf spot and treat as necessary with fungicides.",
      "Here’s an additional tip from me: keep your azaleas in either a cool spot in your garden or indoors under air conditioning between 15 to 22 degrees celsius. Really helps them bloom longer."
